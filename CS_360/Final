how to circumvent proxy
it looks for a certain port
	use a different port
	not a good way
connect to an off campus machine
	vpn, encrypted session
	uses different port
	proxy can't establish an ecrypted session
	can't pretend it's amazon
	isp is forced to either block the encrypted session or let you through

Edge-triggererd interupts(number 4)
why important to non-block
	all the rest of the sockets can't get through, just paying attention to one
if edge-triggered, what change
	level-trigger at level, (when it's high enough)
		interupted as long as there is anything
		if you get some stuff in interupts next time
	edge-triggered
		make sure to read all bytes (get the buffer back to zero)
		only interupts when it goes from zero to something

latency-ping, how long it takes (network traffic)
bandwidth(speed of each theoretil connection)

web-cache
	straight from cache-more bandwidth less latency
	out there
		bottleneck is company-internet
		less people using that speeds it up
